"lol lifted up his shirt to show his gun. Hey 6 year old bud, don‚Äôt try anything, I‚Äôm a super duper tough guy you little weakling. These people are just school bullies who never looked in the mirror and can‚Äôt find meaning in themselves so they try to bring down others to their level of misery."
How are the officers not completely ashamed and embarrassed by this. I guess I understand some people have literally zero empathy but it‚Äôs hard to wrap my head around
"*‚ÄùThey were crying in fear. One of the agents at one point lifted up his shirt, which displayed the gun that he was carrying,"" Mukherjee said. ""The 6-year-old boy was terrified to see the gun. He urinated on himself and wet all his clothing. No one offered him a change of clothing for many hours.""*

Treating children like animals. Dignity for fellow humans has been lost, when it is gone for them it is gone for everyone. There is always another groups to find and mistreat after the thugs have finished with their current targets."

">The family had been staying with a relative in Los Angeles for the previous seven months after **crossing the border legally** for a court appointment through the now-defunct CBP One App to seek asylum in October of last year. They had been **granted parole status in the U.S.** while they waited for their day in immigration court

>The mother brought her two children to the immigration court on May 29 **expecting to continue to make a case for asylum** after fleeing Honduras due to threats of violence. But like many other immigrants across the country, they were surprised to see **their case quickly dismissed as ICE agents waited for them to step out of the courthouse** into the hallway

>The Texas Civil Rights Project says the **family has been placed in expedited removal**, which allows for rapid deportation without a court hearing. The family's attorneys fear **they could be deported before their lawsuit is heard**

They came here legally. It was never about illegal immigration"
"Whenever a MAGA waxes poetic about ‚Äúremoving criminals from our streets‚Äù I ask them why were so busy ambushing people at immigration hearings.  So far the only answer I get is something like, ‚ÄúWell, they‚Äôre here illegally, you think that‚Äôs okay?‚Äù  To which I reply that the folks at these hearings are following the legal immigration process.  I still have yet to get a coherent response to that."
"Ghouls on twitter will be like

‚ÄúI voted for this üá∫üá∏üí™üèæüí™üèæ‚Äù"
I thought they were supposed to go after violent gangs.
">But like many other immigrants across the country, they were surprised to see their case quickly dismissed as ICE agents waited for them to step out of the courthouse into the hallway.

And then people wonder why immigrants don't follow the law.

What's the point of following the law if you get illegally detained anyway?"
"Can we talk more about these immigration cases being dismissed? Why are they being dismissed at such a rate that ICE is waiting outside courtrooms. These are the legal people going through the proper channels to be able to stay in the US. These are the people we want. Doing the work and want to be here. These are the people the right talk about when they say shit like ""we dont mind immigrants, we just want them to do it legally""."
"So wearing masks during a health crisis was bad because of Freedoms not fear of catching an unknown virus. But now ICE can wear masks out of fear, instead of not wearing them to protect our freedom from false imprisonment?"
"*""I was searching for the nature of evil and I now think I have come close to defining it. A lack of empathy. It‚Äôs the one characteristic that connects all the defendants, a genuine incapacity to feel with their fellow men. Evil, I think, is the absence of empathy.""*

These ICE creatures that were part of this. . .

These are monsters who do this. They have forfeited their souls. America has been poisoned by hate. The propaganda must stop. Every society has bad actors. Some out there, can seemingly rationalize cruelty towards children. It is up to the rest of us to make sure those persons are never given power over even the most trivial or minute aspects of life.

We certainly shouldn't give them guns, authority, or the presidency."
Cowards covering their faces. I thought they were proud  of being monsters?
"‚ÄúIn my work with the defendants (at the Nuremberg Trails 1945-1949) I was searching for the nature of evil and I now think I have come close to defining it. A lack of empathy.

Gilbert, the Army psychologist assigned to watching the defendants at the Nuremberg trials"
"Do these people have no souls?

Like, ICE, as an organization, serves a purpose.  I have to imagine that everyone who has ever been a part of it can't just be totally evil.  But if you are doing this, you have to know you are just an awful human being right?"
Kidnapped. The boy was kidnapped.
"They'll remind you in thread after thread, ""This is what we voted for."" They aren't joking. They voted for stuff like this to happen. They're proud of it."
Masked men without identification **kidnapped** a 6 year old cancer patient.  That's the correct headline.
"Fucking scum Nazis! The boy has cancer but you have to terrorize him and flash your gun? And force him to sit in his urine for hours...I hope there's a hell waiting for these people. 

Is this what an alpha male is they keep bragging about? Gross"
"This is exactly what trump voters voted for. 

Cruelty."
"The problem Maga (and Project 2025) have with the NOAA and National Hurricane Center is that they acknowledge that climate change is adversely impacting hurricane strength, etc. They referred to it as a central player in the ‚Äúclimate change alarm industry‚Äù. It also provides data allowing independent research on the topic. Can‚Äôt have that."
"That'll go over well in the midterms.


""Sorry All Of The South, we were too busy paying ICE to disappear your neighbors to not have your grandma's house fall flat on her head from storm winds we would've seen coming only a few years ago."""
Southern states about to get fucked.
"This is insane! I mean, who do they think they are? Just taking away our weather data like that? It's not like we're asking for the moon here. We just want to know if a damn hurricane is coming or not. And don't even get me started on how this is going to screw over the coastal towns. They're just going to be left in the dark, and god forbid something happens, they'll be scrambling with no useful data whatsoever. I mean, what are we supposed to do? Hope for the best? That's not how you keep people safe!"
"Between this and using fema funds to build prisons, I'm sure the coastal states will do wonderfully during hurricane season."
This fucking administration is a shit-show. What sense does this make? None.
"""The permanent discontinuation of data from the Special Sensor Microwave Imager Sounder (SSMIS) will severely impede and degrade hurricane forecasts for this season and beyond, affecting tens of millions of Americans who live along its hurricane-prone shorelines."""
Don't worry. The GOP turned off the weather machines the Democrats were using
"You know that he is going to try and nuke one this year, he always recycles his dumb ideas, as soon as someone mentions the Epstein files on Faux news, that idea will show up again."
[removed]
Climate change doesn‚Äôt exist if you stop monitoring the climate
Why the fuck does Trump want so badly to kill his own voter base? I don't understand it.
"Welp, weather data just became a ‚Äúbuy-in‚Äù for the executive office. Good states bowing to the presidential office in this term will get it; and those that stand against it will not. After the term ends, it will become privatized data for those citizens willing to pay."
Who needs a forecasting system when you have a sharpie?
Are there any alternatives? are people just going to get blindsided by hurricane?
"This is what happens when politicians are so sure they can act without consequence of losing their seat. Republicans in Florida,  South Carolina, etc that cheer this kind of stuff are in no danger of becoming blue states.  There will be some finger wagging and then they'll say ""biden milk price"" and all will be normal to them again."
All because Obama wore that tan suit smh
"What the fuck was all that outrage about Helene and Milton last year for if they were just gonna turn around and do this?

I‚Äôm not saying the current administration is run by foreign assets, but this is yet another suspiciously foreign asset thing to do. Shit like this is just blatant sabotage"
"lol, buckle up southern dumbshits, and remember, you wanted this"
I'm kicking my ass! Do you mind?
As someone who graduated in 2008 I sincerely wish them good luck... they're going to need it.
"CS grads out here getting steamrolled and people still acting shocked like this hasn‚Äôt been the playbook for decades. Tech‚Äôs always been boom and bust, just now they‚Äôve hit ctrl+alt+layoff a bit harder. They flood the market, drop wages, and somehow you're the problem for not having ‚Äúsenior-level experience‚Äù two weeks outta college.

Jr devs? Good luck competing with 10,000 freshly laid-off mid-levels all applying for the same role that pays in exposure...

But hey, at least we got ‚Äútough and competitive‚Äù instead of ‚Äúcompletely broken and soul-draining.‚Äù Glass half full, right?"
Graduated computer science 2019. Got an entry level job right after. Seems I just escaped the churn
"I was a military vet with electrical certification, two college degrees top of my class, and ended up working retail. Thankfully I was able to find a position in my field after a decade of trying. Finally getting lucky by knowing someone.

It blew my mind that nobody cared about my accolades, but the second you even know someone casually... Instant hire. They didn't even interview me, just asked when I could start. 

It's crazy hard out there, and I couldn't even imagine how it is now. Start networking. It's the most important thing imo."
"Can confirm. I recently changed jobs. I got one good offer which was all I needed but a couple years ago when I first started thinking about changing I got three offers easily. After I got hired I was told point blank that I won out in a crowded field. 

I'm someone with a lot of experience. I suspect a lot of kids graduating in my field are going to have to settle for part time work and living with their parents."
A lot of people who pretended 2022 was a recession might be about to get their first painful experience.
">The rise in unemployment has worried many economists as well as officials at the Federal Reserve because it could be an early sign of trouble for the economy.

With wealth inequality as rampant as it is, the economy hasn't been great for lots of people in decades. This is the kind of writing that show people how much higher-ups are out of touch."
"My 88 year old father still thinks a college degree means everything. It took him a while to understand that you can't just walk into a company with a resume anymore. And he doesn't quite understand that ageism is a problem. He changed careers in his late 50s in a field he had little experience in. My very educated 60 year old spouse is having trouble finding white collar work of any kind, likely due to age."
Yeah no wonder no one wants kids anymore lol üòÇ
"Anecdotal of course, but when I was looking into schools for engineering, I was told it was extremely easy to get a job after graduation for engineers.


5 years later, I had been out of school and struggling to find anything and was lucky to end up where I am now.


Keeping in mind I only graduated about 7 years ago, seeing this doesn't bode well for the future.¬†"
"And as homelessness and poverty grows due to an employer's market causing avg pay to decline while inflation happens, the wealthy will continue to decry the poor are all criminals because they refuse to work while simultaneously replacing many of their jobs with AI and not creating jobs. Thank you all you MAGA and Republican voters for 45 years of voting for racism and trickle down economics. It's clearly made America great again like it's 1890."
"Gods, I feel so bad for the zoomers. They don't deserve this.

Said from a millennial that graduated high school in 2009, that was some fun bullshit too."
"it‚Äôs gonna get 100x worse in the next 5 years. We were just told that ‚Äúbtw AI is already way better at your jobs, so by Q1 2027, your jobs will be non existent‚Äù.

Hope they have a good relationship with their parents. It will be a long time before they're fully off the teat.
"Calling it a job market is insane. There is no job market anymore. It's financial servitude from the day that you graduate high school, and people wonder why they are not excited or trying hard in school anymore."
"I am a highly educated and experienced professional. I hold somewhere around 60 credentials ranging from collegiate degrees to professional certificates, licenses, clearances, and certifications. I have \~ 35 years of work experience and specialize in business process management, work management, leadership, and ethics. I have worked in the trades, with several departments of the US Federal Government including in secure sites, and in tech in SMBs and larger corporations. 

Throughout my career I have had a line of people seeking to hire me. I never had to worry about work. Until recently. A lot of that has been drying up since March 2020. Every month that passes, more opportunity disappears. It doesn't get provided to someone else, the sources of those opportunities disappear. Businesses fail, businesses wind up in a situation where they can no longer afford to hire, Federal budgets evaporated. More than ever before in my career have I seen so much money seemingly disappear. What I'm seeing right now, as an exec in a large US Tech corporation and as someone who has monitored the job market since 1988, is grim. I would not want to have to change jobs or look for work right now. 

A lot of people have cited 2008 in discussions like this but when I think about the job market right now, I can't help but think about the Gulf War Recession that started in 1990."
"This ruling lets states like South Carolina cut Medicaid funding from Planned Parenthood... which not only limits access to essential healthcare services but also undermines the rights of low-income individuals and, yeah, I mean, how do we stop this kind of targeted attack on reproductive care when it's already so hard to get?"
"Sucks because this is more than reproductive. PP does STD screenings, cancer screenings, and so much more. Mostly for populations who already have limited resources. The effects of this can not be emphasized enough. A devastating decision that will cost lives and red states even more money to support health systems that will reap the consequences of this."
"Oh yeah, its that time of year where the SCOTUS fucks all of us all at once right before the 4th of July. Hate this time of year."
"This is what disaster looks like, look at the strides taken in the u.s on things like teenage pregnancy rates since the 90s, Planned parenthood and programs like its played a massive role in lowering those numbers."
"Cool so can we cut funding to religious ""health"" organizations. Looking at all you Saint ""x"" hospitals"
"F this anti-women BS.

We are not baby factories.
We are not their servants. (Yes, I know I'm generalizing)

We are people with rights, hopes, and dreams and we deserve respect. We deserve equality.

We bring great value and perspective."
"We should just have two countries....red states can do their own thing.  Educated and talented people will move to blue states.  Already happening.  There will be a surplus of funds, cutting off the free welfare given to MAGA."
"They want us poor, uneducated and reproducing. This way we don‚Äôt complain about the company towns that are coming"
"In 2016 (before project 2025) gop election platform also spoke about how controlling supreme court would result in rolling back bunch of things from roe vs wade, marriage equality, making ‚Äògods law‚Äô the law. All these plans are bearing them fruit

Once again would like to thank all of the geniuses who didn't vote for Hillary in 2016 for absolutely fucking our judiciary and country
"From the AP news article:


>The justices found that while Medicaid law allows people choose their own provider, that does not make it a right enforceable in court.¬†


A law that isn't enforceable in court isn't much of a law then, is it?"
"So, basic human rights only apply when it's convenient???"
"If you're not rich, F- you, the supreme court. This will surely make America great again!!"
Blue states should really stop funding red states.
‚ÄúBut why don‚Äôt people like us?‚Äù  John Roberts
"I live in New England and I know of some Catholic Hospitals that won't perform abortions. 

Does this mean that the state can pull all Medicaid funding from those hospitals?

Not a lawyer, but this seems to be the same thing."
At this point the only way a semblance of this nation will survive is to divorce the blue states from the red. The blue states can have their democracy and the red states can have their kakistocracy.
Planned Parenthood does an enormous amount of good outside of abortions.
And the War on Women continues
"Yeah, it's not a judicial branch protecting the constitutional rights of Americans any more. It's the American Taliban."
"If Trump were president, this never would have happened."
"""Just you wait, once rich people get more tax cuts the economy is gonna boost into overdrive! Its coming soon!"""
Trump's loyalists will continue to artificially inflate all economic numbers.
"If the Republican controlled government says the economy is doing poorly, just image how bad it really is."
">The Commerce Department previously estimated that the economy fell 0.2% in the first quarter. Economists had forecast no change in the department‚Äôs third and final estimate.

What happened in January that could have caused this downturn? No one could have [predicted this](https://www.taxnotes.com/featured-analysis/its-2024-and-trumps-tariffs-are-still-bad-idea/2024/02/09/7j55n), right?"
Say it with me. The Trump Stagflationary Era.
"it's been clear to me from the start that we weren't going to get real information from the administration when they started clamping down on all of the agencies that are supposed to give that information to the public. 

you can't just play tariff war and snatching people off the streets without it affecting anything. 

Glad to see the stock market is shooting up though they just love human suffering so much"
"Anyone else notice that the ""Experts"" seem to always underestimate the performance of the Dems why consistently over estimating the Repubs?"
Winning! I am so thrilled! Can‚Äôt wait for more winning!
What the economy did worse under Trump the thing every economist said would happen cause he had no plan and was erratic about everything. Shocked Pikachu face.
I don‚Äôt believe anything this regime claims
"This is why we have all that tariff money...right?

...right?"
"Whatever the official numbers are, I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs a lot worse"
And the value of the dollar is down 10% so grandma and grandpa can tell themselves that their portfolios are ‚Äúdoing great‚Äù but the actual value has stagnated or declined.¬†
Ahhh(chaos president)choo.
"If brat summer is green, what is recession summer's color?"
Yet stock market still go boom boom for bulls
"Wow, what a shock! Never saw that coming, although I kind of remember every legitimate economist saying it would. Thanks a lot Obama."
The Trumpcession has arrived
Don‚Äôt worry. The 90 day pause on tariffs is almost over. This will surely help
"‚ÄúProsecutors said Monzo‚Äôs social media use showed an interest in violence, far-right extremism and conspiracy theories. He had shared vaccine misinformation and liked posts on X praising Adolf Hitler.‚Äù

Of course."
"Psychotic episodes are real and so are the consequences.

Mental health is important. Compliance with medications, while uncomfortable for some , can be lifesaving...for the person, and others.

Many lives have been changed forever. My heart goes out to the families affected."
">Aiste Dabasinskaite said after the attack. ‚ÄúHe had his headphones in so he wouldn‚Äôt hear us. 

A new fear has been opened."
"Embarrassing to see just how helpless the police were to stop this guy whilst he was running around with the sword as they tried and failed to squirt him with a water pistol ( pepper spray ). 

At one point he ran into someone‚Äôs house and slashed them, another he hid and jumped out on the police slashing a female officers face. 

Why on earth they didn‚Äôt at least have tasers is beyond me."
"This is a tragedy & absolutely fucking insane that the alt-right (look at the article, he's a far right conspiracy nazi sympathizer) is warping people into straight up psychopathic murderers.


At least they're actually being convicted over here without us half expecting the fucking president to pardon them like a cartoon villain.¬†"
Hope he gets to rot behind bars for a long time.

"Just watched a crazy doc on this guy:

"Sounds like he‚Äôs bipolar or schizophrenic, but I‚Äôm sure the heavy drug use contributed to the rapid downward spiral.

So 10 years in prison then

">Monzo then ambushed Anjorin, who was wearing headphones, and did not hear a neighbor yelling to warn him.

>""We were shouting and waving towards Daniel as he came out,‚Äù Aiste Dabasinskaite said after the attack. ‚ÄúHe had his headphones in so he wouldn‚Äôt hear us. It just happened right before our eyes, it was horrible.‚Äù

This gets me. I feel so sorry for the victims, especially that boy wearing the headphones. It's important to have awareness of the suroundings at all times. So many people check out these days, not paying attention to their environment. This kid's first lesson was the harshest."
">Prosecutors said he carried out his rampage during a psychotic episode, but argued that it was brought on by his cannabis use, rather than an underlying mental health condition.

Yeah, fuck you prosecutors. You don't know shit about canabis use."
That drawing looks exactly like Daniil Medvedev
"TLDR:



* Marcus Arduini Monzo was convicted of murdering 14-year-old Daniel Anjorin and injuring five others in a samurai sword attack in northeast London in April 2024.
* The attack, lasting 20 minutes, was described as a psychotic episode induced by drug use, including cannabis and hallucinogens like ayahuasca.
* Monzo nearly beheaded the teen and attacked police and civilians, including a father in his home and two officers, one of whom suffered severe injuries.
* He claimed spiritual beliefs and delusions, including hearing voices and thinking the world was ending, but prosecutors argued his state was drug-induced, not due to mental illness.
* The jury found him fully responsible for his actions; sentencing is scheduled for Friday."
"Did not expect the real meme of ""he is wearing headphones he can't hear us"" to be a part of this story."
"I had to call 911 on a domestic squabble with one dude pulling a Samurai sword on the other. This was in Chicago. Kids were milling about. 

I‚Äôve never seen CPD arrive so fast. Even a sup showed up. (Saw a pregnant woman‚Äôs car get rammed in a road rage incident‚Äîone cop showed up after 20 minutes). 

Lesson here is always mention a sword if you call"
"Kills boy with samurai sword.  
Convicted of murder.

I'm sure he'll get a suspended sentence and be out in 8 months

"So the test for copyright infringement is the extent to which it would ‚Äúdilute the market for their work.‚Äù

I‚Äôll use that if I‚Äôm ever caught pirating movies."
"‚ÄúThis ruling does not stand for the proposition that Meta‚Äôs use of copyrighted materials to train its language models is lawful,‚Äù Chhabria said. ‚ÄúIt stands only for the proposition that these plaintiffs made the wrong arguments and failed to develop a record in support of the right one.‚Äù"
Wow... Ok so downloading movies and games is ok now. Got it.
This is why big AI backed Trump.
"As I understand the ruling they don't need to pay royalties for using the books in training, and they can reuse the material for new training, but in no way I see that they still don't have to initially buy a copy.   
Also they will still be responsible for copyright infringement IF the model put out content that in fact infringes."
Americans still pretending they live in a country with rule of law
Does this mean anyone caught pirating media can just say they are training an AI model?
If the tech industry wants to screw actual creatives they aren't going to have a good time in the long run.

"Yes, losing weight rapidly can cause pancreatitis."
"I'm currently on weightloss medication, albeit not GLP-1 or similar (I'm on Contrave), and my doctor says one of the biggest problems is either patients consider this a cure all and do not follow guidance from the doctors or doctors do not do their due diligence before prescribing. 

The meds I'm on do not work in any way like GLP-1s or similar, but he still performed a full blood panel to make sure there wasn't any underlying issues before we started medication-based therapy. Additionally he told me to advocate for myself and if something is off to immediately call or message him. My treatment has been incredibly successful because of this. There has been some issues but they were anticipated due to rapid weightloos. 

To anyone who has been interested in doing this, make sure your doctor actually takes care of you before throwing drugs at the wall."
"Rapid weight loss is associated with acute pancreatitis a study indicated Ozempic had no more risk than just weight loss.  Just one study isn‚Äôt enough of course but it is actively being studied. It should also be noted failing to loose weight can be fatal too. These meds have a massive impact on death from diabetes,heart attacks and tons of other life threatening illnesses."
">GLP-1 medications list pancreatitis as an ‚Äúuncommon‚Äù reaction, affecting around one in 100 patients. To date, the scheme has received nearly 400 reports of acute pancreatitis from patients who have used Mounjaro, Wegovy, Ozempic and liraglutide, *with nearly half (181) involving tirzepatide (Mounjaro).*

Going by how many people have taken the medications, the 1 in 100 seems accurate for most of the medications 

That said, if nearly half are coming from one medication then clearly that one needs to be addressed..."
"I mean, millions of people with untreated obesity or type 2 diabetes report severe health problems so‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs all a matter of cost benefit analysis."
"I've been on mounjaro for two and a half years and have lost around 60lbs in that time and my a1c dropped by 2 points within the first 9 months and has been stable ever since.

"pancreatitis put one of my sister's in the hospital on and off for three years, she had to eat with a feeding tube because many foods would often make the flares up worse, not something I'd wish on anyone."

Maybe some people are envious of having done the hard work to lose weight, while others take this drug and the weight falls off?  

Anecdotally, my sister talks about ozempic like it‚Äôs the worst thing in the world anytime I mention a new positive benefit of it.

"TLDR:



* UK health officials are investigating reports of acute pancreatitis linked to GLP-1 drugs like Mounjaro, Wegovy, Ozempic, and liraglutide, commonly used for weight loss and diabetes.
* Nearly 400 cases have been reported to the MHRA, with about half involving tirzepatide (Mounjaro); over a quarter of these cases occurred in 2025.
* Pancreatitis is a serious, potentially fatal condition that causes severe abdominal pain and requires hospitalization.
* The MHRA has launched a study to explore potential genetic factors contributing to these side effects, involving saliva samples from affected patients.
* While GLP-1 drugs list pancreatitis as a rare side effect, increased use may be linked to the rise in reported cases.
* Drug manufacturers emphasize the importance of using these medications under medical supervision and continue to monitor safety data."

"Man this hits close to home. I remember when my best friend was falsely accused of rape by his very recent (3 days) ex-girlfriend, and the cops came and picked him up IN CLASS. They forced him to get completely naked once at the police station because apparently that was needed.

He was 16, both cops who were in the room with him when he was naked were adult women, and even though the whole thing was resolved in just a few hours, the only one punished was my friend (mentally).

This is good. Don't force kids to strip naked. Hopefully it becomes the norm to punish these creeps."
">Three officers conducted the search of the black girl, known as Child Q, with no appropriate adult present at a school in Hackney, east London, in 2020.  
The case of Child Q drew outrage when it first came to light in March 2022 and sparked protests.  
A fourth officer will face a disciplinary meeting at a later date relating to no appropriate adult being present during the search. This is separate from this misconduct hearing, and it's a lower level of discipline.

The wheels of justice evidently move REALLY fucking slowly when they're investigating their own. Five years after the incident, and three years after details of the incident were made public, and it's only now that some (not even all) of those involved have been punished? And unless I missed it, there's precisely zero mention of any of the four officers involved being put on leave pending disciplinary proceedings or anything of the sort, so have they all continued in their roles for the past five years while this has been dragged out behind the scenes?

"""Federal prosecutors are appealing Holmes‚Äô release order. Among other things, they expressed concern in a motion filed on Sunday that Abrego Garcia ***could be deported before he faces trial***. Holmes has said that she won‚Äôt step between the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security ‚Äî it is up to them to decide whether they want to deport Abrego Garcia or prosecute him."""
"Just to recap, he was deported to an El Salvador prison without due process, the DOJ refused to return him saying they had no power to do that, then returned him anyway to face false charges, then threatened that ICE would deport him if he‚Äôs let out of prison.

At this point, Garcia‚Äôs case has nothing to do with his immigration status. Trump‚Äôs admin is making an example of him. They want to torture this poor man so every immigrant knows that the same could happen to them if they don‚Äôt fall in line. It‚Äôs cruel and unusual punishment that‚Äôs par for the course with today‚Äôs America."
"Why. Why are people so cruel? Even if he was guilty of half the things they keep pulling out of a hat, it doesn't justify the way he's been treated.

"TLDR:

* He faces human smuggling charges stemming from a 2022 incident and has pleaded not guilty; his defense argues the charges are a cover for his mistaken deportation in March.
* A judge ruled he is not a flight risk or danger and approved his release, but federal prosecutors are appealing, fearing he might be deported before trial.
* Garcia was deported to El Salvador earlier despite facing gang threats; he cannot be sent back there again, but could be deported to another country.
* His wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, has publicly criticized his detention and deportation, describing the impact on their family and vowing to keep fighting for his return."
How much money has the US government wasted by dicking this guy around?
"What's crazy is all the government had to do was admit they made a mistake and just let him go, but this guy for some reason is the hill they want the civil war to start over."
At this point it‚Äôs not even about Garcia. ICE and Trump‚Äôs admin just wants to make an example out of him.
"This helps underscore the point that this whole fiasco was a red herring for Republicans from the start. Their goal from the beginning was to distract Americans from the Trump Administration's unconstitutional actions by spreading partisan messaging that aimed to discredit Garcia in the public eye.

The GOP chose to demonize Garcia and make him out to be a criminal whose rights did not deserve protecting, all so they could drive the focus away from Trump's unlawful actions.

But they also managed to drive attention away from the fact that scores of harmless or innocent people have also been arrested, detained or deported without due process, and many with no criminal records for that matter. 

Trump's immigration agents have also been targeting legal residents, visa holders and applicants, asylum seekers, foreign students, green card carriers, protestors, children, taxpayers, veterans, and even US citizens. They've even been revoking the legal statuses of migrants who have gone through the proper citizenship channels.

The Trump admin has been on the losing side of this battle every step of the way. They've ignored multiple court orders, they've threatened and arrested judges, and they've been brazenly flouting the law at every opportunity. *This* is the real issue.

But Republicans didn't succeed at misleading *all* Americans, as polls previously revealed that a majority [did not agree with the way that Trump has handled immigration](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/25/us/politics/trump-poll-approval.html?smid=nytcore-android-share)

The courts ruled that Garcia was unlawfully deported and denied due process. Judges overseeing the case consistently saw that the Trump admin was violating the law. This is what deserved our attention.

That said, now that Garcia has been returned, the DOJ is seeking to rectify its mistake by charging him with crimes that will warrant his deportation. 

Whether this case has merit or not, the Trump admin will do everything within its power to make certain that Garcia is convicted instead of admitting to its illegal actions.

The decision to charge Garcia with human trafficking‚Äîrather than gang-related crimes‚Äîis clearly an attempt to retroactively justify his unlawful deportation.

**How it all went down.**

Kilmar Garcia was previously granted protection status under US immigration law when an immigration judge ruled he was allowed to continue living in the US and obtain a work permit due to fears of persecution and a credible threat in El Salvador. 

And although this ""withholding of removal"" is not the same as asylum, it requires a greater burden of proof than asylum, making it an even stronger argument against deportation.

The courts ruled that the Trump admin ignored the withholding order and that Garcia was denied due process. The supreme Court attests to this.

> The United States acknowledges that Abrego Garcia was subject to a withholding order forbidding his removal to El Salvador, and that the removal to El Salvador ***was therefore illegal.***

> To this day, the Government ***has cited no basis in law*** for Abrego Garcia‚Äôs ***warrantless arrest,*** ***his removal*** to El Salvador, or ***his confinement*** in a Salvadoran prison. Nor could it.

> ... the proper remedy is to provide Abrego Garcia ***with all the process*** to which he would have been entitled had he not been ***unlawfully removed*** to El Salvador. That means the Government must comply with its obligation to provide Abrego Garcia with ***‚Äúdue process of law,‚Äù***

> Moreover, it has been the Government‚Äôs own well-established policy to ‚Äúfacilitate [an] alien‚Äôs return to the United States if . . . the alien‚Äôs presence is necessary for continued administrative removal proceedings

Garcia's case hadn't gone through the proper proceedings, so if the Trump admin was really intent on invalidating Garcia's withholding order, he had to be returned and afforded legal remedy on this matter.

So here we are. Garcia has been returned, but he is facing charges related to transporting undocumented migrants and not related to any gang affiliations.

This contradicts arguments that Garcia was already afforded due process back in 2019, and that he was somehow charged with being a gang member. There is no such charge and this is not the case.

- Garcia wasn't charged with any gang related crimes.

- No concrete evidence was provided to support the allegation that he is a gang member.

- Garcia's criminal record remained clean.

There was no explicit evidence proving his MS-13 gang status outside of an ""unnamed informant"" claiming that Garcia was an active member of New York's ""Western Clique,"" despite him never having actually lived in New York. This allegation has since been characterized as ""double hearsay.""

> The uncross-examined detective‚Äôs accusation came from an unidentified informant who was also, perforce, uncross-examined‚Äîa second layer of hearsay.

Additionally, the officer that ""authored"" the informant's claim was later fired for several incidents of misconduct, calling his credibility and the credibility of the accusations into question.

Also, the Gangnet database used to flag Garcia as a gang member was disbanded. This system was never meant to be used as the basis for arrests or charges either. 

However, the informant's claim still led police to identify Garcia as a gang member based on him wearing a Chicago Bulls hat and hoodie, which did not hold any evidentiary weight.

One Judge weighed in on this:

> [Judge] Xinis noted that Abrego Garcia has no criminal convictions in the U.S. or El Salvador, and said the evidence meant to support allegations of gang affiliation ‚Äúconsisted of nothing more than his ***Chicago Bulls hat and hoodie,*** and a ***vague, uncorroborated allegation*** from a confidential informant claiming he belonged to MS-13‚Äôs ‚ÄòWestern‚Äô clique in New York ‚Äî ***a place he has never lived.‚Äù***

But what is relevant in this case is how Garcia was unlawfully arrested and deported by the government, and that because of this, he was not provided the due process that he would have otherwise been entitled to receive.

One Reagan appointed judge said:

> ‚ÄúThe government asserts that Abrego Garcia is a terrorist and a member of MS-13. Perhaps, but perhaps not. Regardless, he is still entitled to due process. If the government is confident of its position, it should be assured that position will prevail in proceedings to terminate the withholding of removal order,‚Äù he wrote.

Garcia's case wasn't properly litigated, and now that he is back in the US, the Trump admin is determined to keep him in custody and charge him with crimes unrelated to the accusations that Republicans have made against him.

That said, it bears repeating that this was never about defending the man himself, but defending the rights of all persons who have been illegally detained and/or deported by this administration. 

Republicans would have you believe the former is true, and no matter the outcome of this case, they will continue to accuse all Trump critics of being ""criminal"" sympathizers‚Äî""traitors"" even. But the reality is, we just want the current administration to be held accountable for waging an unconstitutional war against the public."
So let's make a wall around him make them try
"They need to hire private security to meet him as soon as they open the door to let him out. Don't turn him over to immigration unless they drop the facemasks, show IDs, and produce a signed warrant."
"If this is true, I just don't know how any average American can look at this and not wonder if America has become a truly corrupt nation instead of a nation of laws, fairness and justice. A country worth being patriotic about and feeling pride in, rather than a nation where a minority of hateful souls run the show."
"The cruelty of all this is overwhelming. And it just keeps getting worse. The whole point of this is to be cruel, and to scare people from coming to the US. Every day I open the news now it just depresses the fuck out of me. American cruelty and fascism is at an all time high. Hate is thriving and gathering momentum. How people became so mean and hateful en masse is beyond me. I'm embarrassed for America. I'm deeply ashamed of my country."
"We are inching closer and closer to this administration deporting immigrants to Russia, who will quickly send them to die in Ukraine."
"After the SCOTUS ruling, they are going to send him to South Sudan."
They‚Äôre just yanking this guy around like a damn rag doll. Jesus does not approve of these cruel stunts.

What you‚Äôre seeing with Trump and co is a widespread corrective pushback from a mass of people that feel alienated and disenfranchised from their ability to be bigoted, exploitative etc. so I‚Äôd argue this whole maga movement is a symptom or side effect of a lot of social progress.

For what it‚Äôs worth I hate Trump and the maga movement. It‚Äôs despicable disgusting rhetoric and behavior that‚Äôs abhorrent and, to an extent, undoing a lot of social progress.

But I also think it‚Äôs dangerous to take one event or movement and attribute it to the times or to people as a whole. That type of thinking turns into fear mongering and it makes people lose faith in a lot of the very real and provable progress we‚Äôve made as a community of human beings."

"I‚Äôm having a bit of a hard time with 100% sympathy on this one. I am a scientist, I have brought biological samples from abroad into the US many, many times. However, I ALWAYS had to ship them via courier, and they had to be very well permitted (through CDC typically depending on sample type, sometimes with USDA approval). Yes, it‚Äôs expensive, but it is a very standard part of the import process, and this grad student AND her advisor (‚Äúboss‚Äù) absolutely should have known better and planned better. Back in the day (15+ years ago) people used to just bring them on the plane and then when the process changed a bit, SOME scientists would still risk it for the sake of not having to deal with the entire permit and courier process, but this was a known calculated risk shirking the rules that people (typically older scientists) took.

However, this is also very obviously a politically motivated prosecution against an international grad student, science, and Harvard, and there is no excuse for being detained and treated like this. At worst, the samples could have been expected to be confiscated/destroyed, and you may lose your ability to go through the formal permit process and import samples correctly in the future. It‚Äôs all a total circus for show"

So they dropped the original charges before anyone was arrested because if they were arrested with the original charging document they would get off on a technicality for a false statement being in the charging document. They dismissed the original case so they can bring a new, more correctly documented and investigated case, without the errors in the charging document.

">This week is Lightning Safety Awareness Week, which began in 2001 ""in order to call attention to lightning being an underrated killer,"" according to the National Weather Service. So far this year, there have been four reported deaths from lightning strikes in the U.S., according to the National Lightning Safety Council.

No one was seriously injured when lightning struck the water and charged the metal cable that secured the buoys surrounding the swimming area."
"*Several people had swam out to the buoys and were holding the cable when the lightning hit, with others nearby in the water, the fire district said. ""Everybody got quite a jolt, we're so fortunate that injuries were not worse than they were,"" the fire district said.*

This answers the question of how 20 people were simultaneously hit by lightning."
"i live in Tampa, FL, famous for its lightning. some struck either my pool cage or the light pole behind my house because we were fine but everything flickered and the house went white then blue then yellow. it was terrifying."
"I'm just glad everyone's okay. Lightning can be so unpredictable, even on sunny days, ya know? I've heard of cases where people were injured way off from the storm."
"As a kid, I kind of loved lightning for a while, but I was in a pond when it got struck by lightning (on the other end of the pond). What a swift kick to the ass that was for a kid, lol. 

Anyways I just the other day learned about other types of lightning, and ‚ÄúRed sprites‚Äù which I guess are kind of like post lightning aurora, and just absolutely blew my mind. Check this video from the Kimberley in Australia: https://youtu.be/_fGr-NlLTG8?si=YguqcoGtaDbSHXxR"
"I was wading in my creek once when lightning struck a couple miles away, I felt it in the water like a tick from an electric fence way before I heard the thunder.  Got my attention!"
"I would never hang out with any of those people again. 

Hey you going to that party tonight frank will be there. 

Fuck no! Frank pissed off Zeus somehow I‚Äôm not going anywhere near him."
a colorado man was just killed in florida after a lightning strike !
When it starts to lightning get OUT of the water! Most of these people were holding on to the metal cable float boundary.
If you see lightning or hear thunder get out of the water
"pet peeve as an electrical engineer: 

They weren't ""electrocuted"", they were shocked or hit. Electrocution implies they were killed."
Cloudy? Thundershowers? Lets go for a swim! Literally was in the forecast yesterday.

Soooo do they have powers now?
Dumbasses‚Ä¶ you don‚Äôt swim when it‚Äôs lightning
Did any of them become the Flash?
"Lightning can reach 50,000¬∞F‚Äîthat might explain why it hurts so much"
I've always rated lightning as a killer.
Am the only one that feels like lightning is an overrated killer? I feel like so many people are afraid of it it but only 4 deaths this year feels negligible. I‚Äôm still going to choose to go out during a storm and enjoy the rain üòå
I'm old enough to remember the [Congo soccer lightning strike.](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/lightning-kills-an-entire-football-team-1181336.html)
"Once upon a time, it was illegal to resell a ticket for above the original cost. Let's go back to that and the problem would be solved.

Of course, the promotors would miss out on the secondary market's fees that they charge on stubhub and the like, so they would be against it."
Somebody really ought to start scalping these scalpers
"Oh, is reseller the polite word for scalper?"
Ticket scalpers are the reason I've not going to events for decades. Im happy as long as everyone gets paid!
"Wankers, all deserving of a Taylor Swift kick to the nuts."
I wish for the good old days when scalping concert tickets and buying weed were done in the parking lot before a show. Those guys actually worked to get those tickets and risked arrest selling them.
"This is why no one can have nice things, tired of scalpers and touts buying up everything, same with landlords, buy up everything to line pockets"
"I work on the side for a mostly independent music venue and we have been having issues with scalpers for a while. There is a specific scam people pull, almost exclusively through StubHub, and I end up being the person who has to sort it out.  It makes me feel bad, but I have to tell people every so often that they got scammed and I can't let them in, which is never fun. If it's a smaller show, I'll usually let them in, but only after telling them to quit using StubHub, but if it's a sold out show, my hands are tied. 

What the scammers are doing is buying real tickets to shows, listing them on stubhub for *way* more than actual cost, selling them, and then going back to us for a refund on the tickets they sold. The buyer on stubhub is given an email of the ticket, but when they go to use it at the door, it's no longer valid due to the refund. 

One thing I always thought was wild is that they do this for *all* shows, not just high demand and sellout shows. I've had people come in and tell me they spent hundreds of dollars for a ticket to come in to a 450 cap room with 150 people in it and I'm selling tickets for $20 at the door. And it's not like these shows were sold out online from our site and they were given no option other than resale. We keep pretty solid metrics of all that, so it's likely they never looked at our site to begin with."
"Ya man, we used to have to show up day of the show to hopefully buy overpriced tickets from the sketchy dude around the corner for the venue totally not selling tickets"
"As a big music fan, trying to find the venue site to buy a ticket directly from you, if that‚Äôs even an option most times, is insanely difficult. At least for the venues in Salt Lake City or Boise. 

Google is nothing but stubhub or variants, and most venues default to Ticketmaster.

I live 2.5 hours away from both cities, I‚Äôm not driving hoping the show isn‚Äôt sold out to buy it in person. 

The venues or bands must get a kick back because there is no way pissing off everyone going to your show is good business practice otherwise."
"I definitely understand the frustration. I feel our site does a good job of making it easy, but I know that a lot of others do not. I feel part of the reason ours is easy is because of what I said about being mostly independent. When it's shows that we are running, we are working directly with booking through our talent buyers and those shows are sold directly from us. It doesn't stop the scams from happening, but when it's not through companies like AEG and Ticketmaster, it's much less common.

While we do our own shows independently, we will occasionally take overflow shows from other venues that we have good relationships with. That's what I mean when I said ""mostly"" independent. We don't have clausal limitations that we run the show on these type of events, so every so often we will host shows for other venues that do go through those companies. 

It's kind of a difficult problem for me to personally visualize. I have worked in music venues for 15 years and also was a professional touring artist for over a decade. The type of music I like will never be in arenas, and I have relationships with pretty much every venue in my city, so I honestly can't remember the last time I have a bought a ticket to anything. 

What I do know, from being in the industry as long as I have, is that what you say is true: venues are typically awful at making it simple to get tickets for shows. Another thing, it may not be the band themselves that is getting a kick back, it is most likely the booking agency. If you are doing shows where you would be working with AEG or Ticketmaster, you are more likely than not being represented by a booking agency. I would absolutely find it believable that booking agencies are making back room deals with these companies to obfuscate the process of getting tickets for shows."
The 2026 Democratic primaries will be very interesting. I feel like a ton of establishment democrats will be sent to political oblivion.
"This race was not even close. It might get closer but every projection had Cuomo up early only to lose via RCV later on after several rounds. Mamdani leads 1st Round voting by 8 points. This really should be a signal to the Democratic Party that new leadership is wanted. And a signal to Cuomo to not even attempt his independent run. 

Next round Mamdani would have to go against Adams who is about as popular in NYC as herpes, Cuomo who he has already beat once and Curtis Sliwa a loon in a beret who should likely be in jail for assaulting people on live TV."
"I didn‚Äôt think this would happen.

I thought the establishment was too strong and all of the betting odds at least a couple days ago said Cuomo was in control.

Wow."
"Good, fuck off Cuomo.. go cry to Bloomberg who‚Äôs money you wasted"
"Hey old guard democrats, 

People are over your bullshit."
I didn't believe in the New Yorkers to pull this off. Bill Clinton coming in to endorse Cuomo was just the push Mamdani needed.
"Wow. Am I willing to believe that change can actually occur in today‚Äôs world? 

Not yet. 

But it‚Äôs a start."
Please god may Democrats get the message
"As a NYC resident, this is legitimately the first time since being able to vote that I have had any hope. And I've voted in 3 presidential elections."
LETS GOOOOOOO. kick that sexpest to the curb with the 35 million dollars he put on fire. Elon musk levels of political failure.
Smokin on that Cuomo pack
"As a non-NYer, I've been seeing a lot of press about this race and Mamdani was constantly being cast as the underdog. Seems like a really exciting win."
"If this doesn't wake the Democratic establishment up then I'm actually willing to believe the ""controlled opposition"" theories."
People want an aspirational leadership.  That‚Äôs part of what propelled MAGA. They want a leader who won‚Äôt settle for the status quo when everything sucks.
"THIS IS ABSOLUTELY INSANE!!

Everything I‚Äôve heard is the Cuomo was a lock and Zohran was a radical

Oh what a happy day holy shit. I know it‚Äôs stupid to get idk, emotional? But man do I need positive news after the past‚Ä¶ few months."
"Wow. Against both the establishment democrats and the mainstream media he won.

It wasn‚Äôt even close: Mamdani with 43.5% and Coumo got 36.4%. I‚Äôm sure Mamdani would have gotten Lamberts 11.4% too. ¬†(this is with 91% reporting)

He¬†crushed him.¬†

I‚Äôm afraid the establishment dems won‚Äôt concede control of the party, they tried everything to prop up Cuomo. Even the PBS News YouTube video was hilariously bias (that one caught me by surprise tbh).

We‚Äôll just have to take back the party ourselves."
Good. AOC come on down baby. That old coot Chuck Schumer needs to go.
"Now begins the 10,000 year mamdani dynasty good fucking riddance cuomo go back to the suburbs"
"Honestly I'm shocked, figured the establishment would fuck him over for sure. Hell, they'll definitely try again in the general election. 

Still, this is the first step on the road to completely dismantling this dumbass ""Blue MAGA"" mentality mainstream Dems have become obsessed with. Nobody wants Diet Conservatism. Unfortunately, establishment Dems are as stupid as they are stubborn. The proof that the path forward is actual progressivism needs to be crystal clear for these blockheads to get a clue."
"The last thing anyone wants is another geriatric establishment walking corpse in charge of anything. This gives hope to the next generations who have been waiting for the opportunity to be heard. Next up, Schumer."

Like, I‚Äôm glad he did, as it is why he was caught (Thought he doesn‚Äôt seem to be facing charges related to this, at least thus far, which is crazy.), but how did he think this would work out?"

"I read a few articles about this story and the guy and it's all so weird. 

From what I gathered:

\* He's a convicted pedophile

\* Since his conviction, he's been organizing some weird ""happenings"": fake video shoots, gift giving at music auditions, etc... all of these placing him in the middle of a pretty large number of children.

My guess is that he found this ""loophole"" that allow him to live some of his twisted fantaisies, and even have some recordings/photos made out of it. And the mock wedding is another one."
Arrest Roman Polanski next.
"The story mentions has no information on the parents of the 9-yr-old bride.  It's not clear, if she was kidnapped or her parents sold her."
"If you'd told me it was Donald Trump doing this, I wouldn't have been surprised at all.

But what the hell, dude? My flabbers are gasted. Man was BRAZEN."
What's crazy is they're nailing him for fraud and money laundering for impersonating a Latvian and using false documents to secure the contract to hire the park.¬† This is like when they went after Al Capone for tax evasion because that was all they could prove.

"Apparently he does double duty as an ""influencer"" so he was making content to be published‚Ä¶ idk"
I hate to say it...but he probably makes his money by selling content to other freaks like him.
"He is wealthy and uses fake photoshoots to make himself look important on social media as well as buying millions of fake subscribers and followers etc.¬†


He then uses that fake clout to contact girls and families of girls in foreign countries to act like he's a big pop star and he will make them rich and famous. He models himself on Michael Jackson I believe.


It's awful, the rabbit hole is massive.¬†"

"1: The evangelical church has like 13,000 members

2: Banning abortion isn't the same as getting teens to commit terrorist attacks

Never get medical advice from conspiracy theorists unless you want a shorter life.

As soon as that happens I just *know* the type of person i'm dealing with. 9/10 they raw feed their animals too and decline all other vaccines but rabies. Yes, a TF rabies vaccine exists for animals, but you expect me to order an entire tray of a different vaccine from normal JUST for your animal? I so want to just say no and send them elsewhere but it just so happens those types of people are also the types of people to throw hissy fits publically. Really a no win situation for us but we usually are able to just get a few of the TF vaccines from another clinic who keeps a tray. Such a freaking waste of time.

Very common thought process on Reddit too. Any time I post in an article about civilians dying in palestine I get flooded with comments and PM's calling me an antisemite.

Shuuuuu. Their listening.¬†
"Personally, I think lobby groups of any kind should have the right to send angry emails at companies. Management for a **public broadcaster** should have the backbone to ignore such emails though.


I will note though this particular lobby group had a bunch of lawyers threaten legal action against the ABC if they didn't fire her, which does go further than a simple ""Hello ABC I am writing to say I don't like your presenter"". If a follow-up lawsuit does happen I hope it focuses on the legal threats."
Her husband's video is [beyond heartbreaking](https://youtu.be/8qlJir9a1zk?t=9m5s). I've followed Mikayla and Save a fox for years now and she loved her animals so fiercely.

"Someone shared a subreddit that usually dunks on her. But it has gone private.

Also, the husband mentioned her friends were also bullying her, most likely out of jealousy.  So it isn't limited to cyberbullying."
"Caring human being trying to save animals and give them better lives.

Fuck anyone who abused and bullied her for it, I hope those who did read this know you're spinless creatures (that includes everyone at r/SaveAfoxSnark you pathetic fucks)"
Imagine bullying an animal rescuer‚Ä¶
"I never want to see the face of a man hurting as bad as her husband hurts ever again.  The pain is visceral and I'm so saddened that people, behind the veil of anonymity, could direct their opinions at anger at someone.  This world has so much hurt and the mindless ape like masses keep taking out the ones that actually feel something for it..."
"Oh no, this is tragic... She spent so much time and energy saving foxes, and people were bullying her for it? What the fuck is wrong with people on the internet to do something like that to an animal advocate? Goodness, we need more people like her, not fewer... RIP."
"I used to follow her when I was on FB. Sent her some stuff off their Amazon wishlist. She seemed so kind and had endless patience for those foxes, who inevitably get up to stuff including pissing everywhere in the house and shredding her couches and beds. 

Fuck anyone who drove her to this."

RIP Mikayla. I can't imagine the pain you must've been in such that it made you leave your foxes.
"I had a friend who did this because she rescued feral dogs and her land was being sold out from under her and she and the dogs had no place to go. No, it doesn't make sense since she left the dogs behind for her fiance to deal with and it's nothing she would have ever done if she had gotten treatment. But this was in Georgia and she had no insurance. Rescue wears you down, if more pain is added to that it might be the last straw.

If someone you love does animal rescue of any kind - support them as much as you can because they deal with the inhumanity of humans in ways others can never understand."

"Damn that sucks. Her channel pretty frequently pops up on my feed. 

I didn't know anything about her besides the fact that she ran a fox sanctuary, but I assume the bullying was completely unwarranted. Most likely driven by envy and self-loathing, I'm sure. Only losers with their own mental health issues spend time lashing out at others."

>Akil Davis, the FBI assistant director in charge, claimed Park and Bartkus found one another on online forums discussing the anti-natalist movement ‚Äî which asserts that humans should stop reproducing ‚Äî and connected over a ‚Äúshared belief that people shouldn't exist.‚Äù"
Man he could have just skipped a couple steps...
"Having worked in Rikers as a paramedic and health attendance ""nurse"" (sorry term escapes me) I can honestly say I broke my ass keeping guys alive and well. So many untreated diseases! Fuckin diabetes was the Bain of my existence so many didn't know they had REAL issues."
"Amazing how many people ""die in federal custody"" during Trump administrations."
"Why are people comparing this to Epstein‚Ä¶? Dude had no known connection to wealth or power and nothing to cover up

And who‚Äôs downvoting this?! Hahaha I don‚Äôt understand!"
"‚ÄúDaniel Park, 32, from Seattle, was charged earlier this month in connection with the bombing. He was found unresponsive at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles, the agency said in a statement.‚Äù

As someone who lives in Seattle I‚Äôm not the least bit sad about this."
I wonder who he had dirt on
Must have been put in the same cell Jeffrey Epstein was kept in
pussy probably killed himself
Anti-Natalism is nothing more than repackaged nihilism. These extremist ideologies need to stamped out as the boiling ground of terrorism
Why are people saying Trump had this guy off‚Äôd isn‚Äôt he a right winger
"From the article:

> Ammonium nitrate is usually used as a precursor to make homemade explosives.

As far as I understand it ammonium nitrate is most often used as a fertilizer in commercial agriculture, and [its Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonium_nitrate) appears to confirm this. And while it is a component of approximately 80% of explosives used in North America, I don't know that you can call the explosives used by mining companies ""homemade,"" even if they're mixed on site rather than in a factory and shipped to the site (which sounds needlessly dangerous to me).

Assuming those commercial explosives aren't ""homemade"" it's not just semantically incorrect but wildly inaccurate to say ammonium nitrate is ""usually used [...] to make homemade explosives."" I thought better of The Independent."
"Good thing he wasn't a corporate whitleblower, he would've been killed even faster."
Donny covering his tracks just like with Epstein.
"Suspicious death in custody. Should be investigated, was he killed, was he hit by the hitman? Was he killed by the government to cover something up? Someone didn't want him to speak. This is a conspiracy. I guarantee it."
"‚ÄúAfter traveling to Denmark and then onto Warsaw a few days after the bombing, he was detained in Poland earlier this month.‚Äù On his way back to Russia no doubt"
"Weird. He attacked a fertility clinic, not an abortion clinic. Abortion clinic attacks ‚Äúmakes some twisted sense‚Äù in the eyes of ‚Äúpro-life‚Äù terrorists, but a fertility clinic?"
Somehow this process doesn't seem very efficient.
"Per usual, it was a grift.  It was never about ‚Äúsaving money and reducing fraud‚Äù it was about stealing our data."
"Sounds like a waste of money, no? Almost as if it would have been cheaper to not let Leon arbitrarily fire people."
"They are hiring their friends at higher wages, 100%

Edit: thank you to whoever gave me my first award. I‚Äôm glad it was for making fun of Trump üòÇ"
"Cool, cool. Maybe we could, like, undo all the things Elon did AND all the things Trump did, too!"
All part of project 2025. Terminate life long state employee‚Äôs and replace them with inexperienced at sycophants who‚Äôs only qualification is absolute fealty to dear leader.
"How many more agencies are gonna suffer because Trump just couldn't keep his hands off the workforce numbers? I mean, honestly!"
They are implementing new screening processes to ensure they hire loyalists.  This was the plan the whole time.
"You know, I think I see what happened. In the civilian world, especially tech, a great way to cut expenses is to cut headcount. Musk and these techbros looked at the number of federal workers and just blindly and stupidly thought, ""If we cut X people, we will save X dollars."" Then, without any real knowledge or without doing any homework, just started slashing."
This has to have cost us more money than if they had done nothing.
"Across all the companies I work with in the hiring/recruiting space, a good rule of thumb of ""cost per hire"" is around $3k. That includes everything from retail and up, and that cost does not include payroll for the new hire at all. It's the cost of just making them into an employee.

There's a BIG BIG reason companies are constantly trying to reduce turnover. And that reason is money.

So, thanks DOGE for lighting our money on fire for no fucking reason."
A clown show every day. Incompetent clowns. How anyone can still support Mango Mussolini must be attributed to undiagnosed mental illness or pure sociopathy.
"They're about to learn why firing a bunch of people randomly and without cause is a bad idea.

Why would anyone in their right one come back after what they just had done to them? It's going to be hard to find qualified and competent federal workers for a long time after the stunt Trumpy & Musk pulled. We'll all suffer for it, too."
This is what happens whenever we swing Confederate/conservative. This one is particularly bad because the corrupt idiots managed to take over all three branches of government for the first time since the Civil War.
It's almost as if they don't know what the fuck they're doing.
"Watching Trump be president is like watching someone learn how to govern in real time. I'm absolutely convinced that tons of people that had zero experience in government could've done just as well, if not massively better."
Wow. Almost like the current administration has absolutely no idea what they're doing.
"Goes to show the waste of money. Because in firing and those that chose to take the money and go, maby are now returning. So they got a payout and then their job. 

This is more waste but again, when you have mentally unstable individual working with essentially children trying to fix a non-issue, you will get these issues."
What a disaster.  So incompetent.
"Rehiring with higher wages and a bonus, musk is a genius of efficiency. /s"
"ICE also arrested an interpreter for the army, an Afghan man who had risked his life translating for our military in his own country‚Ä¶ so now we‚Äôre shipping him back. And he‚Äôll no doubt be killed once he gets there. 

So we utilize him, then bring him here so he won‚Äôt be executed by the Taliban, give him a protected status visa, then we send him back to die. Makes no sense."
Remember kids next time Washington wants you to go die in the MiddleEast this is how they will treat you once you return home.
">For 55-year-old U.S. Army veteran Sae Joon Park, this was the hardest moment of his life. Not getting shot in combat. Not the years battling post-traumatic stress disorder or addiction. Not prison. It was leaving the U.S., a country he called home for nearly five decades.

>On Monday, Park, a green-card holder, self-deported to South Korea. His removal order was the result of charges related to drug possession and failure to appear in court from over 15 years ago ‚Äî offenses that, he said, stemmed from years of untreated PTSD.

So, instead of supporting our vets (which, realistically, we never did) we're deporting them now?

This is America."
"> Although the U.S. offers expedited naturalization for those who serve honorably in the U.S. military for at least one year, or a single day during wartime, [because of wounds sustained in combat] Park was discharged before he had served 12 months and the invasion of Panama was not classified as a period of hostility.


This fucking country. Seriously."
"After reading the article I see that the invasion of Panama was called ‚ÄúOperation Just Cause‚Äù. I know they meant it to mean ‚Äúrighteous cause‚Äù, but I can‚Äôt help but read it as they invaded Panama because they just felt like it.

‚ÄúWhy did the U.S.invade Panama?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo reason, just cause‚Ä¶‚Äù"
"""Supporting the troops"" has always been a campaign platitude."
"Wow. Holy shit.

I thought at least the rank and file would slow walk things. 

He literally took a bullet for us, and we're like ""well yeah, but we have RULES here. """
Nobody hates veterans more than Republicans
And there are US veteran support groups in Mexico for all the US vets who were deported after discharge.¬†
Imagine thrown to a country you don't remember and know. He left at 7 years and likely he has no one left there. But Trump welcomes white South Africans why ? just because they are white !! this is pure evil
"And yet, veterans and active military voted about 2 to 1 for the current office holder and thus his policies. Thoughts, etc., etc.."
We fucking deported a purple heart awardee while bone spurs is president. I'm so sorry our country failed you when you gave so much.
Anyone that joins the US military and fights for the US and risks their entire life for the US should get permanent citizenship.  If any laws are broken after that then they should be treated like any other US citizen.  Period.  I also believe they all should have free health care for life (everybody that joins the military).  The US is more disgusting every single day in my personal opinion.  And that is sad.  The military seems to be just as fake as the government.  The US doesn't even deserve a military and needs to start being grateful for anybody that willingly signs up.
"There are so many movies and books about people turning to drugs from PTSD from the trauma of war, there was basically no reason not to give citizenship to this guy who lived here effectively his whole life and was wounded in combat for us. Lots of social programs are expensive, one guy who probably needs some medical care and benefits is *nothing*, we can definitely afford this veteran. Acting like he isn't as American as anyone is cruel."
"This is one of the most depressing news I've read today, and that's saying something.  
What a shame."
"Gee, this is just heartbreaking. 55 years old, lived in the US legally for 5 decades, served the country, maybe way more patriotic than people shouting they are the patriot, end up self deporting. What a sad world."
"Wait, even his mother gets to stay in the US but he has to be deported??"
The article is a tough read. Kicking out a good person.¬†
This administration‚Äôs policies are a disgrace.
"My grandfather was a Purple Heart vet who fought for the Americans and survived torture as a POW. His experience in the war haunted him until his death. If he were alive today, I wonder how his adopted country would treat him? I can‚Äôt imagine adding rejection by the country that you fought and nearly gave your life for to one‚Äôs trauma."
">A court in Japan has sentenced a US marine to seven years in prison after finding him guilty of sexually assaulting a woman in Okinawa last year.

>Lance Cpl Jamel Clayton, 22, attacked the woman in her 20s, choking her from behind and attempting sexual intercourse, the court ruled.

>The case is one of a string involving US servicemen based in the Okinawa archipelago, where more than half of the 54,000 US soldiers serving in Japan are based.

>Previous crimes committed by American personnel have sparked anger and protests by locals in Okinawa, the largest of which took place 30 years ago, when tens of thousands took to the street following the rape of a 12-year-old girl.

>In the last year alone, there have been four sexual assault cases involving US service members in Okinawa, including air force member Brennon Washington, who was given five years for the rape and kidnapping of an underage girl by a court in December 2024.

This has been an issue for years, and judging by last year's examples, it's not going away."
Just think - all he had to do was simply *not* rape anyone and he‚Äôd be free
"I spent a year in Okinawa and it's beyond me why our servicemen commit these kinds of atrocities. The Okinawans are wonderful people, but there's no wonder as to why they want the military gone. 

Let these fuckers rot in jail, we don't want them back in the States either."
i wonder does his criminal record follow him back to the us?
Jesus Christ why can't a guy just jack off and leave these poor women alone...?
Good. Then he should get 7 years at Leavenworth when he's released.¬†
This happens waaaaaaayyyy more often than you know
Disgrace to the Marine Corps
It‚Äôs so crazy that this has been going on in Okinawa since before Chalmers Johnson wrote about it decades ago.
"The first recorded incident of sexual violence committed by a U.S. military service member against an Okinawan occurred in 1854, just months after Commodore Matthew Perry‚Äôs first visit to the Ryukyu Kingdom. Perry left behind a  garrison there before continuing on to Japan, where he so famously used gunboat diplomacy to force the opening of Japan.

The incident led to the signing of the Treaty of Amity (Ryukyu-US) which included a stipulation banning service members from committing violence against Ryukyuan women.

https://apjjf.org/2016/16/rabson"
"I was told I was conceived on Okinawa, the product of a Marine and a tourist. The situation was described to me as, ""everyone was drunk and having fun"" yet there are several things that raise red flags, and I think in modern terms it was a rape.¬†


That was about 36 years ago. This has been going on for *decades,* and I've always felt ashamed of my country when I hear of another case.¬†



I want drastic actions taken to stop these assaults.¬†


Edit: This has gotten some visibility and I wish to be clear; my biological father was a bad person. He ended up getting court-martialed for another offense, which demonstrates how wicked and ignorant he was. My adoptive father, an intelligent and empathetic man, was also a Marine, and served 23 years with distinction. 8 years as a Drill Instructor. I don't blame Marines as a whole, yet there is obviously something wrong happening on Okinawa, and nobody in the Corps or our government has ever done enough to stop it."
"Just seven years? It‚Äôs disturbing how often rape sentences are so light, especially when victims are sometimes murdered too. A punishment like this doesn‚Äôt reflect how horrific these crimes truly are. Do the courts really need a victim to lose their life before they treat it with the seriousness it deserves? Crimes like this should get the harshest punishment possible."
His career in politics is taking off nicely
"Actual consequences for US troops abroad? Say it ain't so.


Sad this is a drop in the ocean of all reported incidents."
That is too light of a sentence.
"This kind of stuff happens with in UK bases too, just 2 weeks ago a girl was sexually assaulted by a british soldier in Kenya, and many other cases where they are swept under the rug like murder, hope one day they get justice"
"Good, fucking asshole countrymen of mine should be held accountable."
The U. S is sending their worst people overseas they are rapist and criminals
Way to go. Making America look like the good guys. They need more vetting for overseas members. The amount of people kicked out out may command when I was in Yokosuka for the most horrific shit is astronomical. Lot of it involving child you know whatography. 2 people in one deployment had brig time for it. Like real bread and water underway brig time. Everyone wanted to just run a man overboard and move on.
"This is why there can't be blanket support of military servicemen. There are great people and not so great people among them, and everyone should be judged by their actions, not just their title."
"I'm constantly getting weird Hims ads on reddit. Just  sad looking AI women telling me I'm not man enough for them.

You couldn't pay me to take that shit"
"Hims has trash ads, trying to make people feel bad about themselves to make sales.  They have one where a guy alludes to being impotent makes him not a man.  It‚Äôs pretty gross."
"Hims and Hers seem to be symptoms of an ill health insurance system, not the root problem. I get Wegovy through Hers for $549 per month, which is supposed to increase to $599 after the first six months (who knows what will happen now). When my actual, in-person primary care doctor first prescribed it for me, it would have cost $1200 WITH insurance, for which I pay $1500 each month in premiums. My friend, who takes Wegovy for the same reason I do, gets it for $20 per month because her insurance is better. I would rather not use an online service like Hers, but ????"
Absolutely insane that $600 a month is the *good* price
"It sucks, compounded semaglutide helped me lose 70 lbs without needing to fight with insurance companies or completely drain my bank account. Looks like those days will be coming to an end soon"
"It's a two sided sword and really either way the customer loses. Novo wants to make money and will squash anything that tries to hurt that. Hims wants to make money with compounded GLP1s and subsequently have a cheaper alternative.¬†


Compounding is fine, when done correctly but now everyone wants a piece of this market and when you look at something like the New England Compounding Center deaths...you know inevitably some company cutting corners is gonna kill people doing this..."
"I don't really get how this could have happened - the entire deal was made to combat the compound market with Ro chosen (ironically) specifically because they were one of the biggest compounding companies (well facilitator at least).

How did they not debate and negotiate this topic endlessly?"
Hims keeps trying to say im going bald and it feels demeaning. My hair started to thin when I hit 30 but thankfully has either stopped or slowed down a lot but its a sore spot which im many people feel. Ads targeting those insecurities fucking suck.
Seems like a crack down to stop Hims from selling a cheaper alternative.
"This is shady af but Hims does enable me to get my prescription shipped to me without fucking with my idiot impossible doctor correctly refilling my script, and, dealing with the understaffed time-vampire pharmacy to fill it once my doctor figures his life out. It costs me more money, but I‚Äôd rather pay more than deal with that extra stress - stress for which I need the prescription in the first place"
"Crazy how y'all are jumping on defending big pharma here. 

Very biased article. Tons of research says that compounded drugs are perfectly safe. This very well could have more to do with them losing tons of money than safety. 

Some things to note about how bad this article is: it provides zero context for the ""1000 complaints."" Is that a lot? Is that more than the standard version? Were they legitimate complaints? Is there a placebo effect with *any* compounded drug? Did the complaints correlate to the safety standards of the compounding pharmacy? 

Also, note that there is no comment from hims or a similar teleheath program. 

Just crappy journalism."
"Oh, you mean the assholes that made a shady underhanded deal with CVS Caremark to force everyone on Zepbound to switch to their inferior Wegovy. Maybe make a better product instead of forcing customers to use your shitty alternative."
"I got my medication from hers (same company) and they've been great about it. Regular checkins with an np asking how you're doing, the medication itself is excellent.

>""When companies engage in illegal sham compounding that jeopardizes the health of Americans, we will continue to take action,""

This is horseshit and scare mongering. I've lost 35lbs with zero side effects. They're just upset you can get the same medication for cheaper."
"Novo Nordisk has some nerve calling others unethical.  Their mark-up is obscene, simply because they supply ""pens""."
"If a pharmaceutical company ends their money-making partnership with you for ethical reasons, you might be really fucked up."
"It's worrying how Hims & Hers was pushing these unapproved drugs for as little as $165 a month... when the real thing costs way more, and with all those side effects being reported it just seems reckless."
"""When companies engage in illegal sham compounding that jeopardizes the health of Americans, we will continue to take action,"" said Dave Moore, executive vice president of U.S. operations at Novo Nordisk.

Mhmm just smells like your trying to keep prices high and keep on making money while limiting access to those with the ability to afford it and there for not improving the health of Americans"
There are no white hats in this story.
No shit? I just called out a HIMs ad for Wegovy.
I love that reddit showed me an ad for the very same product by the same provider they're talking about just a page down after reading through this post üòÇ
Just tell me what color the danger is so I can be terrified into appropriate levels of compliance.
Our current head of anti-terror is a 22 year old who used to mow lawns and once did an internship at the Heritage Foundation. Wish I was kidding.
We're back to threat level orange boys!
"It's kinda wild how these warnings are so vague when real threats are already causing such devastation... like, how exactly do we stay safe if the risks are so unclear? I mean, over 650 people have died in this conflict already and it's only getting worse."
The terrorists are in the white house.
"I'm only worried about cops, fake ICE agents and white dudes with guns."
False flag 7-1 through 7-4
Translation: false flag coming
Imagine if Trump we‚Äôre president. This would‚Äôve never have happened.
"*eye roll, jerk off motion*"
"Trump was warned by Iran before he struck.  
Iran still has it's program and the half billion dollar strike failed.  
We will be targeted for terrorism....

and the guy Trump put in charge of counter terrorism is a 22 year old large dollar donor with no experience at all. I am not kidding.



PS: trump is why Iran had a program at all when he canceled the world heralded nuclear agreement we had with them on his own.

PPS: when terrorism hits it hits big cities not red towns, and they know this so do not blame what comes on incompetence."
So call 911 every ICE proud boy sighting
"So Trump campaigns on no wars and peace. 

Is this what Americans consider peace? I mean, a lot, in fact a crazy amount of you voted on his policies."
Get the fuck out of here üòÜ
The terror is coming from inside the administration.
Good thing we have a 22-year-old in charge of a crack team protecting the nation.
Can you imagine what a group of terrorists could do dressed as ICE agents?
"*universal jerking off motion*

Just a reminder that the terrorist who shot and killed democratically elected representatives was a U.S. born and bred conservative."
Bull. This is Trump trying to stir the pot.¬†
"Since I STAY in a constant state of alert thanks to the U.S. not appropriately dealing with the domestic terrorism problems i.e. white supremacist/Christian nationalists, this ""warning"" makes no difference."
Nothing says I love you like an entire city telling you how much they hate you and your money.
"Excerpt from the article

> Greenpeace on Monday became the latest group to protest the lavish wedding Amazon owner Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez have planned in Venice. Members of the environmental organization and British group ""Everyone Hates Elon"" unfolded a giant banner in central St Mark's Square with a picture of Bezos laughing and a sign reading: ""If you can rent Venice for your wedding, you can pay more tax.""

> Local anti-tourism activists said they were determined to disrupt the festivities, saying city bosses were prioritizing tourism over resident needs.

> They have already hung anti-Bezos banners from the city's famous Rialto Bridge reading ""No space for Bezos!""

> ""Bezos arrogantly believes he can take over the city and turn it into his own private party venue,"" said Tommaso Cacciari, from the ""No space for Bezos"" campaign.

> Greenpeace said it wanted to draw attention to the low taxes many billionaires pay, while allegedly exacerbating the climate crisis through their unsustainable lifestyles.

> ""The problem is not the wedding, the problem is the system. We think that one big billionaire can't rent a city for his pleasure,"" Simona Abbate, one of the protesters on Monday said."
"It's just mind-blowing how someone like Bezos can throw a huge party in Venice and still pay next to nothing in taxes... but hey, at least that donation he made to the environment research is something worth noting."
"Everyone, stop using Amazon and use a family-run store... Oh, there aren't any!"
I hope they hear the protests every minute during that wedding
"Thank you Venice! Love, An American"
Yes! Keep it up Venice! Make sure the streets are still full of dog poop like when I went there 20 years ago
Barcelona  to ship water-pistols to Venice for Billionaire Bezos' Big Day Out?
"I hope he breaks Venice and the piazza falls in, and then Italy sends him a bill."
"oh, but guys, Bezos recently said on a news show, with a serious, thoughtful face, that he plans to donate *most of his fortune*! What a good man.

Or, he stole that money from workers and has no right to donate it to anyone but back to America. The guy is a terrible human."
Someone tax these people for crying out loud
Protest with your wallet. People hate bezos but will still use Amazon
"I couldn‚Äôt imagine going forward with a wedding where I was not only unwelcome, but local protests make headlines. How disruptive for everyone and painfully disrespectful. He needs to read the room, move the venue to one of his own massive, lavish properties then honeymoon in Europe."
"I hope EVERYONE protests. Bezos has been blessed with the rare opportunity to make this world so much better - to help protect nature , reverse climate change, improve the lives of children, support refugees fleeing violence and famine- and he‚Äôs completely squandering it."
"finally, Greenpeace does something that isn't batsh\*t f\*\*\*ing insane."
Aww Lex Luthor getting hitched again? Wonder if he has the next 3 wives lined up.
"Wouldn‚Äôt it be awful if tons of people showed up and threw bags of shit at the wedding party?, man would that be terrible. Especially water balloon launchers, that could really toss it far, you wouldn‚Äôt want those. 


I suspect there are no farmers that could help supply a truckload of shit, so it could never happen."
"I read this as ""Bozo's wedding...""


Feel free to use that."
Wasn't there a similar banner spread out saying that if he can rent Venice he can afford to pay his workers more?
I remember there being some sort of outrage involving his wife a couple years ago. Is this another wife?
">Indonesian rescuers tried Tuesday to reach a Brazilian tourist who fell down a ravine at a volcano popular with hikers after spotting her unmoving body, authorities said.

>The woman identified by relatives and media reports as Juliana Marins, 26, went missing on Saturday at Mount Rinjani on Lombok island, which neighbors Bali.

>Authorities think Marins fell and believe they spotted her on Monday but rescuers were held back because of bad weather.

>""Yesterday morning we detected the victim. We deployed a team to the location but we were hampered by the very steep terrain and the foggy weather,"" Muhammad Hariyadi, head of Lombok's Mataram Search and Rescue Office, told AFP on Tuesday.

>""When we detected her using a drone, she was not moving.""

>Hariyadi¬†[told the Reuters news agency](https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/indonesia-races-rescue-brazilian-hiker-stranded-volcano-cliff-four-days-2025-06-24/)¬†that Marins was slipping further on the sandy terrain. She was at a depth of about 500 feet when she was first located, but had slipped to more than 1,600 feet by Monday morning, he told Reuters. 

Considering the effects of the initial fall as well as possible gases within the volcano, the fact she's not moving is not a good sign."
"Apparently she died

https://www.nationalworld.com/news/world/juliana-marins-brazilian-tourist-found-dead-after-falling-from-cliff-near-crater-of-active-mount-rinjani-volcano-5192563"
I want to know why they were abandoned by the guide. What happened up there?
"Really fucking sad. I actively try not to follow these types of news, because it just bums me out. Here in Brasil it's all the talk for the past few days.

Unfortunately a close friend of mine was friends with her sister. I can't imagine the pain the family had to endure just to discover that she died.

Fuck the government there. There were a lot of compounding mistakes happening to end this situation this way. Really tragic."
"Juliana was found dead.

And if there is one thing Indonesian authorities did not do, it's race."
"I've been following this and they are doing BUT racing. At least from the government side. The last I read, a group of climbers with equip were on their way to help. She had been up there for some 60+ hours with the local government not doing a thing. I did see a rumor that the local government posted on socials that she was rescued so they could open the volcano and trails back up to tourists."
"It's really concerning how long that tourist was stuck there and how slow the local government's response was... especially since they apparently posted on social media claiming she was rescued just to reopen the volcano for tourists, which sounds like a serious failure in accountability. Rescuers had to track her movement from 500 feet down to over 1,600 feet using thermal drones, and it all started because her guide left her stranded more than an hour before she fell."
"Why didn‚Äôt they send her down a blanket and water supply, and protein bars. They were using drones, couldn‚Äôt they have dropped her off supplies with the drone? If the sand was too soft to walk on, could they have roped down supplies? Why is there not procedures in place for these situations?"
Brazilian media is reporting the rescuers found her dead. Rest in peace. Insane negligence from the Indonesian government. She should be alive.
"RACED: ""Took their sweet fucking time for 4 days""."
"""she slipped and fell off a cliff on the side of the 3,726-meter (12,224 feet) mountain, according to Indonesian authorities.""
I am not a doctor, but I assume the fall alone would have caused death. Very tragic."
"Remember your life has little value in other countries, sometimes as much as $100 for a guided tour"
The Indonesian government lied about rescuing her. Scumbags
They ‚Äúraced‚Äù to find her four days later.
"The fault lies with those who think volcanoes, whether active or not, are places worth visiting despite the risk. Look at the recent Mount Etna eruption where all those tourists were scrambling down to get to safety. Or remember those that died while on a visit to a volcanic island that suddenly erupted near New Zealand."

"I‚Äôm about to go for the 3D2N trek on Rinjani in exactly 5 days. Also in a group of 6 pax. Been following Juliana‚Äôs case since 2 days ago and man, I‚Äôm so torn. She didn‚Äôt deserve this.

The govt could have handled this so much better, SEA really needs to buckle up. Not even sure if it‚Äôs the right move to go anymore. Was really looking forward to Rinjani but aaaaah‚Ä¶ someone send me a sign.üò≠"
"It's a recovery activity now. Sadly, she is dead."

At the time, what???  Is this an AI summary or something?"
Wow. What a shit show of a rescue effort

After a little pushback from the public on why they needed a special operation to find missing kids, State Police came out and reported that only four were actually missing](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/us-marshals-service-123-children-rescued-michigan_n_5bbe49e3e4b01470d0583d5a?guccounter%3D1%26guce_referrer%3DaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8%26guce_referrer_sig%3DAQAAAGfaRrn7gGeXjspx44LWOEzXp2b3ABk6_0PQVZZMUcX_ao3zx4Jc4HtqaazQk25CzciKyk6O2diYMjVAMHj8Ncg-2NbCcRNkTIJIRNoifIIlSLpCbq11QYRY0zj79KFoJiHYMdwXpqlUCJQ52Lu9HV3XR2XJ62Jx4q7L9-ENH9eH). The rest were kids reported as missing at one time (and did eventually return to their parents/guardians) but were never followed up on until then.

In this case, they did mention 8 arrests, so that could mean it‚Äôs something more substantial, so maybe good work?"
">‚ÄúThis operation had three primary objectives: recover critically missing youth, provide them with essential services including appropriate placement, and to deter bad actors exploiting missing child vulnerabilities,‚Äù officials said in their announcement of the results of the operation. ‚ÄúDRAGON EYE resulted in eight arrests, including charges of human trafficking, child endangerment, narcotics possession, and custodial interference.‚Äù

More Dragon Eye, less Midnight Hammer please."
Did they raid Matt Gaetz\`s house ?
What is critically missing versus non-critically missing children?
"Those arrested were US citizens, not illegal immigrants."
"This story is critically missing a lot of information.

Whenever I read these word-salad stories I assume like 3 kids ran away from their parents for being gay and the cops are not returning them. They can run away again, cops can get another good story out of it, Reporters can do PR. The circle of life continues."
Turns out they were in a closet at Mar-a-Lago next to some classified documents.
And not a single Transgender person was holding those kids
"Y'all really need to at your representatives to shore up home school laws, regulations and enforcement.


It's way way too easy to just disappear kids in the US."
"Headlines like this drive MAGA fantasies of worldwide abuse rings that are taking children at a frightening pace. In fact, stranger abductions are very rare. In almost all cases the child is with a parent involved in a custody dispute or has run away to escape parental abuse."
Let me guess maralago
They were all in Ron Desantis‚Äô shed.
"This is actually good news. And good work to the men and women who brought these kids home and to safety. 

Thank you all."
I feel like this is a better use of funds than deporting brown people without a criminal record.
It‚Äôs nice to get good news
The children Trump tore from their parents his last time at bat?
Fb suggests Kashapp Patel did this single handedly. Did he call Mat Gaetz?
"The ""critically missing"" phrase had me wondering how it differed from *normal* missing (if such a thing exists).

The article elaborates:

> The USMS defines **""critically missing""** children as those at risk of crimes of violence or those with other elevated risk factors such as substance abuse, sexual exploitation, crime exposure, or domestic violence, authorities said, and recovered children were provided with medical resources, nourishment, social services and child advocates."
"Had my wedding at this hotel 17 years ago. Great night for everyone in that hotel who came to party in the penthouse. Now when I walk by it and see what has happened to it, I am quite saddened by the state it‚Äôs in. Still have the memories.

JPM will buy it up and know it down. They are on a spending spree."
At least we still have the statue of Liberty for their arrival.
"""Grand"" is sort of in the eye of the beholder. I think such an ambitious facility welcoming migrants was just as grand as a glitzy high-end hotel."
"""Once grand""?? The Roosevelt is an awesome hotel.  I've stayed there many times.  It's still fucking grand.  It's not like a pack of squatters trashed the place"
Don't say that too loud or the administration will turn the island into a prison. Alligators optional.
We're one recession away from melting it down for profit.
For now.
"All that copper just sitting there going to waste in the harbor?  We could sell that to pay for ICE!

I hate that this could be a thought that goes through that fucking moron's head....."
Im surprised AP editorialized like that tbh
"I think it shows a proud, ambitious, classy side of our culture and of NYC itself, personally. A culture that was once happy to actually be a coveted and desired place to be - in a place that is literally THE melting pot.

As an American navigating perma residency in Canada because my SO doesn‚Äôt want to be an immigrant in America right now, it all just makes me sad."
"> ... the hotel was vacant as of Tuesday afternoon, according to Mayor Eric Adams‚Äô office. ...

>
> The future of the storied hotel, which the city had leased from its longtime owners, Pakistan‚Äôs government-owned airline, remains unclear. Representatives for the property didn‚Äôt immediately respond to an email seeking comment Tuesday.

Once grand as in the hotel is now a past tense. Read the articles and not just the headlines, maybe?"
"I‚Äôve stayed there for work many times, it certainly isn‚Äôt grand. The lobby was ok, but the rooms were incredibly small and dated, even by NYC standards. The only redeeming factor was the location. By the time I stopped going there, large migrant families were packed in these tiny rooms."
I‚Äôve seen this john carpenter film
We are on the Russia track. We would melt it down for cannons.
"The inhabitants of the US have never been happy about immigrants.


When Germans immigrated in the 1790s to Pennsylvania, the Anglos treated them terribly. They were run out of town and their children weren't allowed in school.¬†


Charity schools set up in post-civil war Massachusetts to teach formerly enslaved children did not accept Irish kids.¬†


When southern Italians poured in to NYC, they were poor, illiterate farmers who spoke a variety of Italian dialects. Mediterranean ppl were considered by educated whites to be inferior. Their catholicism made them suspicious. New Yorkers burned Italian churches & businesses. In southern cities, Italian men were lynched.¬†


I could go on.¬†


I think it's important to be realistic about America's history because if we think immigration was sweetness & light in the past, we get the idea that somehow we've now descended into barbarism when in reality we never got out of it.¬†"
"You‚Äôre actually absolutely right and this was well said. I think the bulk of my pain is that, as a 30 year old I was raised by people, including a grandmother fresh off the boat from Italy, who saw it continuously get better throughout their lifetimes. I too thought it would just continuously get better, and I‚Äôm realizing how painfully naive that assumption is about humanity and the cycles we move through."
"> Charity schools set up in post-civil war Massachusetts to teach formerly enslaved children did not accept Irish kids. 
> 
> 

these schools ""excluded"" all whites, Irish and otherwise, to indirectly facilitate excluding blacks from essentially all catholic, private protestant and early public schools that the Irish kids had varying but collectively much more access to"
"IMO technically unless you are Native American Indian, or relative thereof-we are ALL immigrants. Just because one group came in first and decided to be assholes to those who came second(and to those who actually had this land)-does not erase-that they too we're immigrants."
*alleged federal agents
">Hernandez also criticized ICE agents‚Äô practice of wearing masks while conducting immigration raids, describing it as ‚Äúabsolutely horrifying.‚Äù

>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs literally creating fear, and people don‚Äôt feel safer when they see these vehicles,‚Äù he said.

This IS the point. Fear. The masks, guns, unmarked cars, goon squads, chaotic scenes. It's all part of the plan. They want people to be afraid."
He did what he said he was going to do to you.
"That was his dad? Jesus. According to CNN, the guy was just working landscaping when masked agents tackled him in broad daylight and started beating him in the head and neck. No record, undocumented, been here since the 90s. His son‚Äôs a Marine and literally watched him get shoved into an unmarked vehicle. This isn‚Äôt how a country treats the families of people who serve. What‚Äôs the endgame here?!?!"
">‚ÄúThe illegal alien ran, then turned and swung a weed whacker directly at an agent‚Äôs face,‚Äù said McLaughlin. ‚ÄúHe then fled through a busy intersection and raised the weed whacker again at the agent. The illegal alien refused to comply every step of the way‚Äîresisting commands, fighting handcuffs, and refusing to identify himself.‚Äù 

And of course the video they shared doesn't support that.

It shows a guy walking away from some unidentified masked man.  And when that guy sprays something in Barranco's face, he naturally flails his arms and the weed whacker he's holding moves with them.

Then they proceed to beat him as they throw him into their car because a guy with his arms handcuffed behind him and two guys holding onto him wasn't able to get in fast enough to please them."
[removed]
The idea that conservatives are cool with masked government agents ‚Äúarresting‚Äù people says all that needs to be said about American conservatism. They‚Äôre just fascists. We are living in a fresh autocracy.
"Unless identification is shown, they should be treated as armed kidnappers."
"All working for Trump, the draft dodger."
"Since January 20, the Trump administration has aggressively ‚Äî yet quietly ‚Äî expanded a controversial program that delegates immigration enforcement powers to state and local law enforcement agencies across the country that are normally prohibited from investigating and arresting non-citizens based on immigration violations.

The 287(g) program, named for the corresponding section of the Immigration and Nationality Act added in 1996, enables the Department of Homeland Security to ‚Äúenter written agreement‚Äù with state and local agencies to ‚Äúperform a function of an immigration officer.‚Äù 287(g) agreements are uniquely powerful for two reasons: (1) they allow U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement to quickly and dramatically expand its enforcement reach far beyond its current formal capacity, and (2) they allow non-federal agencies to overcome the longstanding prohibition against states doing their own immigration enforcement."
"I wonder all those groups that supported üçä,  Latinas for Trump, Arabs for Trump, Gay for Trump, etc....wondering if they regret their choices now..."
More Anti-mask insanity from the right
I feel betrayed by people who voted for this.
So grab your brothers and end this shit
There should be a bill prohibiting face and ID covering introduced yesterday.
"Yes. I'm sure he thought he was ""one of the good ones"" (rolls eyes).

Trump made no secret of his intentions. It's also not really a secret that his most fanatical supporters want a white Christian ethnostate, which does not include Hispanics.

So what did this guy expect to get from his Trump vote? A pat on the head and a cookie?"
"If masked men without police uniforms or other identifying apparel came at me you better beleive I'd defend myself. And that, I am convinced, is the entire point of the ICE scum charade. They **want** people to be afraid and they **want** to encourage violence. It feeds to their disinformation."
"LOL, First time as a Military officer being F'd in the A by your government? Those are rookie numbers..."
"As always, the key question is: who did the outraged family member vote for?  Those who voted for Trump are getting exactly what they asked for.  Trump promised, and Trump is delivering on the promise.  12 million deportations was the target.  To hit that number it will have to be a mass roundup of everyone, no matter how law-abiding.  So he's given orders to get the number up.  All as promised."
"Headline leaves out the ""beaten"" part I see."
"Hard to believe but he was quite the teen pop idol a long time ago, in the days of David Cassidy and eventually Donny Osmond."
My introduction to [Bobby Sherman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WtElHY0d1k)
"OK, this is weird. We're watching a '70s show called *Emergency!* which is about the building up of the paramedic squads in Los Angeles, and he's in the episode that's on right now. His character is an arrogant young intern who is dismissive and condescending to the EMTs he encounters. I suspect he'll get his comeuppance soon.

But then I read the linked story, and learned that Sherman himself became an EMT and CPR instructor years later, and evidently did a lot of good there. Funny how life works.

RIP Mr Sherman."
"I remember being 3 or 4 years old and pretending to talk to my boyfriend Bobby Sherman on the telephone.  That would have been around 1970. My mom and grandma thought it was very cute. 

RIP honey."
"I remember him from ‚ÄúHere come the brides‚Äù about women being sent to Seattle to theoretically marry the Seattle loggers and miners. The song for the show was spectacular! 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_(song)

Should‚Äôve known it was composed by Hugo Montenegro. Enjoyed your work Mr. Sherman, RIP.
Edit: especially as a Seattle native born and raised."
Boy does this make me feel old.
RIP to him.  And his bangs.
CPR teaching is important.
His pages torn from Tiger Beat covered my bedroom walls. üò¢
"Oh Bobby, you were such a cutie, we'll miss you."
":-(

Bobby Sherman.. blessed be
Mine was David Cassidy and of course Gage in Emergency ‚ÄºÔ∏è
I saw him perform in Orlando when I was 9 or 10 ('69 or '70). He wore brown and off-white vertically striped leather pants. The man was stylin'.
I was 8 years old when we moved from the countryside of PA to LA county.  Easy Come Easy Go was popular on KHJ.  Still a favorite song of mine. I sing it at karoke.
"Though it he was so cool.

 And loved the show Here comes the Brides"

"Wait a minute, that‚Äôs just Mr. Beast."
I remember him being on the covers of Tiger Beat and 16 magazines
half of redditors parents weren't even born then lol
"Dude tripped into a 300-year-old painting trying to ‚Äúmake a meme‚Äù and tore the canvas. Like, man, you can‚Äôt even make this up! The Uffizi had to shut the whole exhibition down for repairs, and apparently this isn‚Äôt even the first time this month something‚Äôs been broken over a selfie. Museums might actually have to start making no-selfie zones at this point."
"Just days after some moron sat in a crystal chair in an art gallery.

These are not interactive displays you idiots."
"Idiots truly are ruining museums for everyone. 

If you go to a museum and start taking photos of yourself, you are in the wrong place."
This is some kind of sign that confirms our accelerated path towards Idiocracy that folks have been talking about.
18th century artform meets 21st century artform.  \[chef's kiss\]
People.  What a bunch of bastards.
"The Belvedere Museum in Vienna has a ""no photos"" sign next to Klimt's *The Kiss.* But in the next room they have a full-size reproduction of the painting, mounted so people can stand next to it and take selfies."
"I appreciate we can enjoy the art but we really need to keep them reasonably away from simple human mistakes. People lose their balance trip or do dumb things accidentally. 

I went to a beautiful glass art project and it was literally all right there for someone to reach. 

Some crazy person could easily cause so much damage or just a person trying to stand for a photo and bump into things."
I think it says a lot about a person who goes to a museum and tries to make it about themselves.
"First of all that guy is a utter baffoon, but at this point all art should be behind thick plexiglass as apparently people can no longer be trusted"
"I wish we had something like ""no phones allowed"" in museums. I understand wanting to dhare the experience but maybe pay extra for that or something."
When are museums going to start protecting their shit? These stories are infuriating because they're so easily preventable.
‚ÄúIdiot tries to make meme and becomes meme. More at 11:00.‚Äù
Useally there are guards in the museums to tell you to back off. This is one of the stories that highlights how important that job is and how more common it should be in a museum. Sigh.
"I can understand wanting a selfie, as a reminder that you were actually there. But it should (1) not interfere with other patrons, and (2) be taken from a safe distance from the piece. Things like this should not happen.¬†


I saw an article within the last week that the Louvre is having problems with crowds. Apparently, the Mona Lisa exhibit is very crowded and it's nearly impossible to really see the painting, because of meme-style pictures.¬†"
"Just ban photos, it'll keep the insta crowd away"
"Maybe the Uffizi should consider installing proximity sensors, as other art museums have."
Museums should employ more docents. This shit could never happen on my watch.
Humans. What the fuck.
"I used to be a regular museum goer back when I lived in the big city. 1. No pictures were allowed around the artwork. Flashes are damaging to old paintings and fabrics. Plus a ton of other reasons. 2. There were ropes, trip lines, and guards. What happened?"
"Unless that car comes with a new car price, I don't think any of the end customers are going to complain that everything is new."
"I think this primarily points to how brutal the price war is in China right now. Local governments have invested heavily in their local production, and these companies are seeking a backdoor profit mechanism to unload inventory.

There is the knock on effect that this will be double counted in GDP. It's also a sign that the CCP doesn't really have as much power over local governments as reddit memes. The end-countries probably have more pressure to regulate this grey-market inventory, so this isn't really sustainable in the long run either.

In any case, what probably will happen is the Chinese EV industry will consolidate into a few companies. The real risk is if consolidation occurs after global markets push back hard, when reputational damage and regulatory walls are already up. This probably damages Chinese auto brands trust globally, but I'm not sure this will be felt too hard by the big players (like BYD)."
"*These so-called ""zero-mileage"" cars have never been driven but they are being exported as used to markets like Russia, Central Asia and the Middle East, allowing Chinese automakers to show growth and to dispose of cars that it would be difficult to sell domestically...*

This is a regional Chinese position and not that of the central Communist Party, which is trying to set across-the board standards on the auto industry."
"Isn‚Äôt this how European delivery programs work on German cars already? You receive the car in Europe, drive it around a bunch, then they import the car for you as a used vehicle? Yoy save a bunch of money on import costs and basically trade off that cost for a cool trip to Europe where you can rip your sports car around on German highways."
" Wait until I tell you how GDP works.

That said, always interesting to read about law adoption, enforcement, and the reality gap of what happens in between. Equally important/impressive is the ability of journalists to gather this information - good job to the boots on the ground."

That‚Äôs a ponzi play can‚Äôt last but subsidies by China keep going it‚Äôs not about the truth but what tha masses believe
Lol .. not surprising though. Is any data coming out of China trustworthy?
I saw this episode of Rescue Rangers in the early 90s where China car company shrunk down cars to avoid shipping costs but enlarge to make cars look like expensive high end cars. But if water hit them they shrank down up clunkers.

  They do that because a used item is less likely to be a knockoff. ( in theory anyway) and most people would rather have a good used item than a fake."
You mean China lies about its books? Noooo really?

"The problem is that the national government doesn‚Äôt want that. 

Factory jobs are effectively being supplemented by these paper transactions, so if that practice gets cut it opens up opportunities for layoffs at the factories."
"the issue is that factories are cutting corners when building these ""new used"" cars. these cars were originally built just to scam the government out of subsidies, they werent originally intended to be sold to customers. the fact that they are now being sold to customers is a quality and safety concern

aside from that, this could easily turn into the Evergrande of the EV auto industry. by inflating sales numbers, the industry is overleveraged. they qualify for loans and other perks that they would not otherwise qualify for. EV brands have even been scamming parts suppliers and not paying them back for almost an entire year due to their reputation based on inflated sales. companies have more credit than they should because they appear to be selling and growing way faster than they actually are. and if the sales margins now suck because everything is so cheap, they wont be able to repay these loans and then default and the entire industry collapses."
"The issue is they are mostly selling bellow cost at this point and hiding debt by outsourcing it to suppliers with crazy payment terms that obfuscate attempts to gauge industry health. So they take delivery from the supplier, with terms that they will pay in 160 days, the supplier then goes to a bank and says we need money to keep us running until we receive payment, look, we already delivered the orders and the money will come in. 

But now instead of the car company taking out the loan and having the debt on their books, its now pushed onto the supplier, so the car company can report better financials because they changed payment terms to push out when that money actually get paid out to another time frame, meanwhile the supplier compensated for this buy taking on debt, that the car company might have otherwise had to assume with a normal payment schedule. 

China way overbuilt EV manufacturing capacity, and the price war they are internally facing is not sustainable, and these kinds of financial tricks being used are emblematic of the actual pain these companies are feeling because of it.

The CCP is not super happy about it either, as they previously held a meeting with all of the major companies to get them to agree to not have a ""race to the bottom"", which it appears didn't work at all."
Pumping up numbers is a way to commit fraud against banks and investors.
"That's not the issue.

The issue, is that they inflated the number, which gave the wrong impression and statistics to everyone, including investors, bankers, and the government."
Utterly besides the point.
China and a not so iron grip on local governments': Name a more iconic duo?
This reminds me of the bike graveyard from a decade ago
